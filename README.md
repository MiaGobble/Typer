# Typer
Strict typechecking in runtime for Roblox.

## What is Typer for?
Typer is best-suited for anything that needs to guarantee userdata matches expected types. In Typer, you can:
* Create "static" functions that assert parameter and return types
* Evaluate tuples to match types in order
* Cast userdata to type
* Check equivalency with type assertion
* Create an environment for immutable values
* Use "expects" in a format similar to Promise to create callbacks for whether or not types are correct

## Installation
Download from Wally: `typer = "miagobble/typer@0.1.0"`
